Fullstack web developer with 3 years of experience in PHP Symfony and Vue.js, I have contributed to the development of complex applications, leading a team of three developers. Comfortable from frontend integration to back end, I design high-performance, maintainable, and well-structured applications by combining rigor, attention to detail, and close collaboration with product and design teams. I am proficient with PostgreSQL databases and RESTful APIs, and I work daily with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Git.

Current project: [trickledown.js](https://trickledown.ghartemann.fr), a purchasing power simulator
