### Hi! This is my GitHub profile.

I'm Guillaume and I've been a web developer for almost three (!) years now. My main stack is Vue.js, Symfony and Postgresql. I'm also learning Svelte and Python.

### 🔭 On my free time, I work on multiple projects at once:

- [Clic & Eat](https://github.com/ghartemann/clic-and-eat): a recipe database, grocery list creator and restaurants guide I'm co-developing with a UX/UI designer.
