### Hi! This is my GitHub profile.

I'm Guillaume and I've been a web developer for a little bit less than a year now. I've learned PHP, Symfony and JavaScript at Wild Code School. Since then, I've been self-studying things like Vue.js.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on multiple projects at once:
- [ReleaseProphet](https://github.com/ghartemann/releases-calendar): a calendar-based app that lets you add release dates for films, TV series and video games to your own Google Calendar.
- [Clic & Eat](https://github.com/ghartemann/clic-and-eat): a recipe database, grocery list creator and restaurants guide I'm co-developing with a UX/UI designer.
- [NK ULTRA's Sh*tty Synth 2000](https://github.com/ghartemann/checkpoint-4-shitty-synth-2000): a working JavaScript synthesizer! Next step: MIDI integration. It's already been deployed [here](https://shitty-synth.ghartemann.fr/).
- CLAF-Outil: Classification Légale des Armes Françaises - Outil is a tool I'm working on for a friend. It's not public yet for privacy reasons.
